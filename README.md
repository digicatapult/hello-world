# Hello world (NPM)

This repository contains a minimally-useful NPM "Hello world" Express server. Its main purpose is to validate feature development against reusable workflows, i.e. purely as a consumer, and to perform end-to-end tests and releases to various registries (Docker Hub and GHCR), with low-impact dummy images.
